# React-CrownClothing

Link to the live web application => (https://db-crownclothing.web.app) \
A Frontend, React/Firebase "E-Commerce" Web-application.\
This project utilises Firebase backend with its authentication services along with a Reactjs front-end.

Some of the features:

1. Application contains a responsive, reactive cart for the products.
2. Uses Stripe API as a method for payments.
3. Provides a sign-in/sign-up with email or google as login methods.
4. Uses cloud based backend provided by Firebase.
5. All of the styling has been done with styled-components, a Reatjs library.

This is the project with which I learned React up from the very basics. Faced a lot of challenges and enjoyed the incredible experience.
